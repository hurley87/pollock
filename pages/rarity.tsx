          All Pollockesque NFTs are generated using a combination of the
          following traits. Each trait has a different impact on the final
          artwork, and each Pollockesque NFT is unique. {"There's"} a rarity
          score for each trait, which indicates how common that trait is in the
          collection. The rarity score is based on the number of Pollockesque
          NFTs that have that trait, and the total number of Pollockesque NFTs
          that have been minted.

          Techniques
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Drip painting (40%) <br /> Pollock is most famous for his drip
          paintings, in which he would drip, pour, or fling paint onto a canvas.
          He would move around the canvas, dripping and splattering paint from
          different angles, creating intricate and dynamic compositions.

          Splatter painting (30%) <br /> Similar to drip painting, Pollock would
          fling or splatter paint onto a canvas, creating a more random and
          chaotic pattern.

          Pouring (20%) <br /> Pollock would pour paint onto the canvas,
          allowing the paint to flow and mingle, creating a layered and complex
          effect.

          Palette knife (9%) <br /> Pollock would also use a palette knife to

          effect.

          Brushwork (1%) <br /> Although less prominent in his work, Pollock
